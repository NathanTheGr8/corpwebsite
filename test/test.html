Flash performance can vary according to I/O pattern (read, write, mixed, burst, continuous, random, sequential), and its performance level can degrade as much as 90+% as its occupancy increases (“how full the disk is”). When storage performance and predictability matter, administrators must keenly monitor occupancy. Flash uses buffering to conceal 1.4 ms write costs. Constant, durable load can exceed buffering and result in poor performance.</p>
                <p>Compared to DRAM, Flash performance varies considerably across I/O profiles, depending on whether the storage is reading or writing, using small or large block sizes, providing sequential or random access, or running continuously or in burst. Usage wear influences performance, and wear leveling, block retirement, and RAM buffering diminish, but do not eliminate, this concern. Even with buffering, Flash latency lags behind DRAM performance.</p>
                <p>Latency, bandwidth, and IOPS all degrade through time in Flash. Performance varies across block size, and administrators should test each manufacturer’s product against their application to ensure that manufacturer design optimizations actually deliver against requirements.
